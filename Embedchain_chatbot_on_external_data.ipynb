Continue holding the \"Menu\" or \"Set\" button until the maintenance mode message appears on the printer\\'s display.\\n6. Once in maintenance mode, use the numerical pad or arrow keys to navigate through the menu options.\\n7. Look for an option related to resetting the purge counter. The specific wording may vary, but it should be something like \"Reset Purge,\" \"Purge Count Reset,\" or \"Clear Counter.\"\\n8. Select the appropriate option and follow any on-screen prompts to confirm the reset.\\n9. After the reset is complete, turn off the printer and then turn it back on to exit maintenance mode.\\n\\nPlease note that the terms used to describe buttons may vary from one printer model to another. For example, \"Start\" may be labeled as \"Menu\" or \"Set,\" and \"Stop\" may be referred to as \"Exit\" or a red button.
